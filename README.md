## Textbook and Resources

1. Automate The Boring Stuff With Python By Al Sweigart
2. [Ryba's CS111 practice problems](https://qccs.me/classes/cs111/ryba/website/)

**Note::** The textbook is the launching pad for introducing topics in a concise manner but it will **NOT** be followed in order. While the example problem solutions on Ryba's page are in C++, the problems given encourage fundamental practice that can be applied to any programming language. All solutions can are expected to be written in Python.
